# Design Documents

This directory contains detailed design documents for complex components that require careful planning before implementation.

## Documents

## Design Document Template

Each design document should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Component Name

## Problem Statement
What problem are we solving? Why is this complex enough to need a design doc?

## Requirements
- Functional requirements
- Performance requirements
- Constraints

## Proposed Solution
Detailed description of the chosen approach

## Alternative Approaches
Other solutions considered and why they were rejected

## Implementation Plan
Step-by-step implementation approach

## Testing Strategy
How we'll verify this works correctly

## Risks and Mitigations
What could go wrong and how we'll handle it

## Open Questions
Items that need discussion or investigation
```

## Review Process

1. Design document is created as a draft
2. Review together before starting implementation
3. Update document with decisions made during review
4. Document serves as reference during implementation
5. Update if implementation diverges from design
